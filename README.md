# YOLO-Object-Detection

This is a Streamlit-based application for performing object detection using the YOLOv5 model. 

The model detects objects in both images and videos, providing results such as bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores for the detected objects.

Users can upload an image or video, detect objects, and download the annotated output.

## Features

        Upload an image for object detection.
        View detected objects and their bounding boxes in real-time.
        Download the annotated output image with detected objects.
        
    Video Support:

        Upload a video for object detection.
        Process the video frame-by-frame to detect objects.
        Download the annotated output video with detected objects.
